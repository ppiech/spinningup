    "My Hierarchical Reinforcement Learning architecture consists of a lower-level (Actions) PPO policy which chooses actions for the environment and a higher-level (Goaly) PPO policy which sets goals for the Actions policy.  There is also an inverse-dynamics model trained to predict both the action and goal taken at each step.  \n",
